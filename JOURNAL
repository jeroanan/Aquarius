It's been a while since I've done much on Aquarius -- started a new job/new life offline, which has sucked up a good deal of my time of late.

Anyway, I'm back now, and there's still a whole bunch of stuff to be done here. I'll be using the issue tracking functionality on this project's github pages to keep track of both enhancements still to be made to Aquarius, as well as bugs I've run into while putting it through its paces.

I am currently able to use Aquarius to search through my collection of ebooks to an extent and download books I find onto my mobile device. It's not quite my go-to solution yet; I hope to get it there over the coming weeks and months.
